# Unit Converter

A **Streamlit-based Unit Converter** application that allows you to convert between different units of measurementâ€”specifically Length, Weight, and Temperature. This app not only provides fast and accurate conversions but also enhances user experience with fun animations and voice feedback using the Web Speech API.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a modular unit converter in Python. The core conversion logic is implemented in a separate module (`unit_converter.py`) and then integrated into a dynamic web interface using Streamlit. After a conversion is made, the result is not only displayed on the screen but also read aloud by the system.

## Domain

This application can be useful across various domains, including:
- **Education:** Helping students and teachers quickly convert units during lessons or homework.
- **Engineering & Science:** Assisting engineers, researchers, and scientists with unit conversions required for calculations and experiments.
- **Finance & Business:** Supporting professionals who need to convert units for logistics, inventory management, or technical analysis.
- **Everyday Use:** Serving anyone who needs quick, reliable unit conversions in daily tasks.

## Features

- **Multiple Conversion Types:**  
  - **Length:** Convert between meters, kilometers, miles, and feet.
  - **Weight:** Convert between kilograms, grams, pounds, tons, and ounces.
  - **Temperature:** Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- **Voice Feedback:**  
  The conversion result is spoken using the browser's Web Speech API.
- **Animations:**  
  Visual effects (such as snowfall) are displayed after successful conversions.
- **User-friendly Interface:**  
  Built with Streamlit, ensuring a clean and responsive user experience.
- **Customizable Voice:**  
  Easily change the voice for text-to-speech by modifying the JavaScript in the `speak_text` function.
