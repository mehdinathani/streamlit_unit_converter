# Unit Converter

A **Streamlit-based Unit Converter** application that allows you to convert between different units of measurementâ€”specifically Length, Weight, and Temperature. This app not only provides fast and accurate conversions but also enhances user experience with fun animations and voice feedback using the Web Speech API.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a modular unit converter in Python. The core conversion logic is implemented in a separate module (`unit_converter.py`) and then integrated into a dynamic web interface using Streamlit. After a conversion is made, the result is not only displayed on the screen but also read aloud by the system.

## Domain

This Unit Converter is designed to serve a wide range of domains:
- **Education:** Ideal for students and educators who need quick, reliable unit conversions for homework, projects, or classroom demonstrations.
- **Engineering & Science:** Useful for professionals and researchers requiring accurate unit conversions during experiments, design calculations, and technical analyses.
- **Everyday Use:** Perfect for individuals who need fast and easy conversions in daily tasks.
- **Finance & Business:** Beneficial for logistics, inventory management, and other business scenarios where unit conversions are frequently required.
